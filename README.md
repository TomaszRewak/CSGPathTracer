# CSGPathTracer
A constructive solid geometry bidirectional path tracer.

![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TomaszRewak/CSGPathTracer/master/Resources/example.png)

I've created this project to learn CUDA. It's not fully polished, as for example the scene has to be compiled with the source code and is not read from any external file. There is a chance that I will work a little bit more on this project in the furute but only after I get myself a stronger GPU then the one in my 6 years old laptop :D
